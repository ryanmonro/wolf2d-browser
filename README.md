## 2D Version Notes

After hearing about how Zelda: Breath of the Wild was initially prototyped as a 2D game, I thought it could be fun to do the opposite and turn Wolfenstein 3D into a 2D maze game. Kind of like Castle Wolfenstein, which Wolf3D was based on. This won't run without the assets, which as per the license cannot be distributed with the source code.
Here's a video of it in action.
